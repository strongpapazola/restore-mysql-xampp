# restore-mysql-xampp

STOP! Please do NOT delete ibdata1 file!

Deleting this file is like playing a Russian roulette with your databases, it could work and restablish everything, but also, probably could leave unusable every database you have.

Instead, first try using the MySQL backup folder which is included with XAMPP. So do the next:

```Rename the folder mysql/data to mysql/data_old (you can use any name)
Create a new folder mysql/data
Copy the content that resides in mysql/backup to the new mysql/data folder
Copy all your database folders that are in mysql/data_old to mysql/data (skipping the mysql, performance_schema, and phpmyadmin folders from data_old)
Finally copy the ibdata1 file from mysql/data_old and replace it inside mysql/data folder```
Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel
And, voil√†!

=================================================================
```[ERROR] InnoDB: Missing MLOG_CHECKPOINT at```
It seems that your database has table corruption causing this problem. Please backup the data directory /www/server/data first

Add the following parameters to the mysql configuration
```[mysql]
innodb_force_recovery = 6```

Then restart MySQL and immediately use mysqldump to export the data to the database. After completion, remove innodb_force_recovery, then re-create the database and import the data.
